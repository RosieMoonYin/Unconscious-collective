            "Only when we know our own darkness can we be present with the 
                darkness of others."<br><br></p>

        <p class="blurbmain">    <strong>Unconscious Collective</strong> is on mission to shine a light on the 
            shadow of our consciousness üî¶ <br>when we dream it is as if we are 
            falling ~ 
            <br>falling deep down into depths of our own mind ~ 
            <br>swimming in a thick soup of our thoughts.
            <br>time works differently down here 
            <br>and the rules are not as we know.
            <br>though in this place I am convinced there is treasure to be found ‚ú®
            <br>perhaps the biggest challenge we face is 
            <br>bringing that 
            treasure back with us to the conscious realm ~ 
            <br>communicating it 
            <br>& integrating it into our <strong>collective reality</strong> ~

        <h3>What happens when we sleep?</h3><br>
        <p class="About">We think our lives are liner and there's a logical sense to it
            because we follow the manmade time,
            <br>which is a Christianised westernised time,
            <br>which is clock time.
            <br>For me dreams are circular time,
            <br>They are spiral time,
                suspended time,
                cyclical time,
            <br>which is life and death time,
            <br>which is nature time,
                seasonal time,
                feminine time,
            <br>which is eastern time,
            <br>which is ritualistic time, 
            <br>that time is specific to <strong>dreams</strong> for me.
            <br>And its illogical ~ it doesnt make sense 
            <br>but perhaps, through that lense life doesnt <em>make sense</em>, we just think it does.
        
    
            <br><br>The truth is language has limits when describing our complex reality - by using a lot of words we can 
            draw the shape of what we are trying to say, we are defining the edges. Just as the event horizon telescopes 
            define the black holes by what can be observed around them. The more data we can gather the clearer picture we can 
            obtain on the question <it>What happens when we sleep?</it> 
            <br><br>Philosopher Carl Jung dedicated much of 
            his life to understanding the subconscious realms, seeking meaning and patterns in the chaos. 
            He believed there are stories and archetypes that we share, he called this the 'collective unconscious'. 
            Jung obviously did not have access to data in the same way we do today, I often wonder what he would have 
            discovered if he was able to work with the tools we have today. 
            <br><br>UNCONSCIOUS COLLECTIVE aims to explore patterns and find meaning in the dreams you submit, 
            just like traditional science experiments the more data the clearer the understanding, 
            so please submit as many times as you like and try to be precise in how you describe the dreams.</p><br><br><br><br>

        <p class="Dreamscapes">Some findings suggest that we experience different universes in our dreams and 
            many of us have reoccuring dreams in the sense that we recognise the dream universe 
            is one we have visited before even if the narrative of the dream is different. <br><br>
            On this platform we refer to these as Dreamscapes. I am very interested in trying to 
            recreate these dreamscapes in our conscious reality usually they take the form of art.

    <section id="Journal"><h3>Dream Journal</h3><br><br>
        <p class="Journal">Submission #1 'The Witches' <br><br>
             <em>I am alone walking around ~
                usually I am in the village where I grew up ~ <br>
                Suddenly the floor begins to open up and small black holes appear. <br>
                At first they are small and I can jump over them, then the holes grow larger <br>
                to at least one meter wide with very little space around them! <br>
                By this stage I'm running trying to reach safer ground, <br>
                innevitably / eventually I fall into a hole. <br>
                In each hole is a Witch. there are three types of witch.<br>
                Witch number one, is a surprisingly friendly Witch she actually welcomes me in <br>
                and makes me tea there is no danger associated with this witch. <br>
                The second Witch is creepy and dark, she scares me with her presence <br>
                and I feel so much fear and unease... I struggle to leave but always manage <br>
                to crawl back out and escape.<br>
                The third Witch is the worst, she inflicts physical pain. Falling into this hole<br> 
                will often times result in being stabbed by a knife in the most vulnerable<br> 
                places and thrown back out of the hole. Once I move through the different challenges of <br>
                the Witch's, I end up in the park where there is one much larger hole üï≥Ô∏è <br>
                inside is a swirling galaxy of stars üåå and a selection of people closest to me, <br>
                I must choose who to save from this hole ~ in order ~ not knowing how many <br>
                I will be able to save in total üîÆ <br><br>
               
               A reoccurring dream since early childhood ‚òÅÔ∏è</em>
